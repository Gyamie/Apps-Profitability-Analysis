# About Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
<p><b>Profitable App Profiles</b> is a project focused on identifying mobile app profiles that are lucrative for both the App Store and Google Play markets. As a data analyst, the objective is to assist a company in developing Android and iOS mobile apps by providing data-driven insights into the types of apps that are likely to attract more users.</p>
At our company, we exclusively develop free-to-download and install apps, with our primary source of revenue coming from in-app advertisements. Therefore, the success of any app we build largely depends on its ability to attract and retain users. The goal of this project is to analyze data and provide actionable insights to our development team, enabling them to make informed decisions about the types of apps to build.<br>

## Project Overview
Our project aims to achieve the following objectives:

<ul>
<li>Identify profitable mobile app profiles for both the App Store and Google Play markets.</li>
<li>Provide data-driven insights to guide the development of apps that are likely to attract a larger user base.</li>
</ul>
<br>

## Key Project Topics
This project will explore the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Pandas</li>

<li>String methods</li>

<li>Emojis</li>

<li>Regular expressions</li>

<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
</ul>
<br>

## Data Sources
To conduct our analysis, we will utilize the following datasets:

<ul>
<li>Google Play Store</li> 
<li>App Store Apple</li>
</ul>

These datasets contain valuable information about mobile apps available on both platforms and will serve as the foundation for our analysis.<br>
 
## Installation
To reproduce our analysis, follow these steps:

1. Download the requirements.txt file and save it into your working directory.

2. Create a conda environment with Python 3.x:

       conda create --name env-name python==3.7
   
3. Install the required packages from the requirements.txt file. Ensure you are in the directory containing the file:

       pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Activate the environment and run the Jupyter Notebook:

       conda activate env-name

<details>
	<summary>Data Quality Assessment</summary>
	<br>
	<p style='text-align:justify;'>For this project, the first step involved assessing the quality of the data. This included checking for any missing values, inconsistencies, or anomalies that could affect the analysis. The data quality assessment aimed to ensure that the datasets were clean and suitable for further analysis.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</summary>
	<br>
	<p style='text-align:justify;'>Once the data quality assessment was complete, the next step was to clean and preprocess the data. This involved tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data types to ensure consistency and accuracy. Data cleaning and preprocessing were crucial for preparing the datasets for exploratory data analysis.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Exploratory Data Analysis</summary>
<br>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the datasets and identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. This involved using statistical methods techniques to uncover meaningful information about app profiles in the App Store and Google Play markets. EDA provided valuable insights that guided subsequent analysis and decision-making.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Statistical Analysis</summary>
<br>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>Statistical analysis was performed to further investigate relationships between variables and to make inferences about the data. This involved conducting hypothesis tests and correlation analysis to understand the factors influencing app profitability and user engagement in the App Store and Google Play markets.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Feature Selection and Engineering</summary>
<br>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>Feature selection and engineering aimed to identify the most relevant variables for predicting app profitability and user engagement. This involved selecting meaningful features from the datasets and creating new features that could improve the performance of predictive models. Feature selection and engineering were essential for building accurate and effective models.</p>
